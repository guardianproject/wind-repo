AutoName: Units
Description: |-
    A powerful unit-aware calculator and converter inspired by GNU Units.

    It can convert between â‰ˆ2,400 different units, making it an ideal unit converter
    for complex or obscure tasks. It has everything - from basic distances, volumes
    and temperatures, to kitchen weight-to-volume conversions, to chemistry- and
    physics-specific units and equations.

    Units can convert between dimensions, for example, multiplying distances to get
    area and volume.
