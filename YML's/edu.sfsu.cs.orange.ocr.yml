AutoName: OCR Test
Description: |-
    '''NOTE:''' This app is no longer maintained, its repo was archived.

    N.B. The direct translation function won’t work as it requires API keys which
    are not in the source. It is possible to long-press the result to copy it, so
    that it can be pasted into a browser or a dictionary.

    Experimental app for optical character recognition (OCR). Runs the Tesseract OCR
    engine on your device to find text in images captured by the device camera,
    without uploading your images to a server. It is suitable for recognizing
    individual words or short phrases of text.

    The default single-shot capture runs OCR on a snapshot image that’s captured
    when you click the shutter button, like a regular photo. When the "continuous
    preview" checkbox is checked, the app shows a dynamic, real-time display of what
    the device is recognizing right beside the camera viewfinder. The continuous
    preview mode works best on a fast device.
